[Music DH](https://rutgersdh.github.io/musicdh/) is an open-source bibliography of specialized digital resources and born-digital scholarship in music. Contributions were crowdsourced from several professional organizations, including the Music Library Association, the Society for Ethnomusicology, the Music Encoding Initiative, the American Musicological Society, and the International Society for Music Information Retrieval. Curated sections on collections and exhibits, editions, reference works, open data, software, and a “laboratories” or miscellaneous category provide entry points into the world of music digital humanities, loosely interpreted. The entries in this directory were compiled over a period of five years: 2018-2023.
